            <p>
              The emergence of Bhoomithrasena in Govt.Model Engineering college can be traced back to 2015,following the
              footsteps of a nature organization called 'T.R.E.E' and later developing into a fully fledged
              organization.

              In the midst of lockdown Bhoomithrasena along with NSS MEC joined hands to bring out the artistic

              solutions to yield maximum benefits out of the trash and thus contribute towards a cleaner and greener
              environment. The challenge also helped the students to think out of the box and to get re-energized during
              the long break. Around 25 students took up the challenge and posted photographs of their own created
              “gems” in social media and inspired others too.

              In the summer of 2020 Bhoomithrasena organized a Water pot challenge understanding the scarcity of clean
              sources of water with the increasing heat. People were asked to hang water pots from trees or balconies in
              their houses itself. The water remains cool and hence it is very effective in preventing dehydration in
              birds in extreme heat. This challenge brought out a simple demonstration of coexistence without much
              effort. Many people participated in the challenge and uploaded the photographs of their hanging water pots
              in social media.
